Ranging from the theoretical, say discrete mathematics, to the practical, starting a business.<p>All of these different topics, when made accessible immediately and in most cases for free or at a little cost (libraries, MOOCs, youtube videos, books, etc), result in a sort of &quot;information paralysis&quot;. There&#x27;s too much to do, too easily, and I end up doing nothing.<p>This really got my attention yesterday morning when I was watching an Algorithms lecture, and my girlfriend pointed out that the lecturer looked familiar. That&#x27;s because I had watched the same lecture 12 months ago and she caught a glimpse then also.<p>I could have done the course twice over, if I had stuck with it and not gotten distracted. But I didn&#x27;t, and 12 months later I know nothing more than I did back then about this subject. This scares me.<p>This scares me especially because I&#x27;m at the start of a 4-5 month stretch where I absolutely need to cover 4 highly technical subjects, on my own and unguided, to continue my studies. (Details omitted for brevity)<p>I&#x27;ve faced this dilemma before and tried to tackle it on my own, and failed. So I&#x27;m posting here in the hops that some other students &#x2F; professionals have encountered a similar problem and found a solution. It may not be perfect, but it might give me a step in the right direction.<p>Thanks in advance for any comments.<p>Michael","time":1423906435,"title":"Ask HN: The “I want to do everything but end up doing nothing” dilemma","type":"story"}
